      <h3> The Plan & motive</h3>

      <p>
        I started my channel at 16, driven by a desire to show off my aggressive playstyle and
        get manhunts over top players. Inspired by Widdz, the feared PC player, I adopted his playstyle but focused on
        console, where I saw an opportunity to stand out. I initially struggled to gain recognition, so I started
        posting build videos to attract viewers, targeting players who weren’t necessarily the best but still wanted
        effective strategies. While I knew my gameplay wasn’t flashy at first, I aimed to build a loyal audience by
         providing content that resonated with everyday players. My ultimate goal was to improve and become better than
         just "good" to earn respect from the community and make a name for myself.

      <h1>The start</h1>
      <p>
        After months of making videos with no growth, I was ready to quit. I told myself my next video would be my last, hoping for a miracle. <br>On September 16th,
        2018, I posted "2 Hard Hitting Insane PVP Builds 1.8.3(Toxic Noob on Floor)|The Division|" at 2 AM before school, rushing the editing. When I woke up, I didn’t
        check my phone until I was at school. By the first block, I saw my video had over 400 views, which sparked a new drive in me. Throughout the day, I planned future
        videos and engaged with every comment, even the negative ones. By the end of the day, my video had gained 22 new subscribers and over 1,000 views—far beyond what I expected from my “last” video. <br>

      <h2>The Gain</h2>
    <p>
      As I started gaining traction, I spent hours alone practicing, going for manhunts, strafing, and aiming.
      This gave me plenty of content to post, and I began creating warm-up routines and challenges to showcase
      how even the hardest or worst builds could work. I lost track of my growth as I got caught up in the grind—playing,
      practicing, editing, and balancing school. I don’t even remember hitting 1,000 or 2,000 subscribers, but one number
      stuck with me: 4,000 hours of watch time. That’s when I realized I could monetize my passion. I applied for YouTube
      AdSense, and within 30 days, I was earning money. This fueled me even more to keep pushing and, at the same time,
      I became known in the community for my skill and relentless pursuit to beat anyone, with some even fearing the idea of appearing in my videos.

     <h2>The money</h2>


     <p>
      As I started earning money from YouTube, I looked for other revenue streams like sponsorships and wagers.
      I got commissions from music artists to use their tracks in my videos and partnered with small dropshipping brands.
      My lethal aim and skills also helped me earn money through 1v1s, 4v4s, and tournaments. With a solid group of like-minded
      grinders, we dominated 4v4s, Twitch wagers, and tournaments, even forming a squad called "The Doctors." I felt on top of
      the world, with money rolling in and just a $35 phone bill as my only responsibility. I reinvested into better gaming equipment
      for my channel, but little did I know, everything was about to come crashing down.

     </p>

     <div>
    <h2>The Die Off</h2>

     <p>
      I didn’t realize how close the end was until it was almost too late. My hunger and arrogance blinded me
      o the warning signs. My friends told me to leave The Division and move on to a growing game, but I didn’t listen. I was still
       in love with The Division, hoping to reach the level of players like Widdz, but even he had moved on. The game I had poured so
       much into was dying fast—no new players, no fresh content, and Division 2 couldn’t even survive. The squad I’d built, "
       The Doctors," started to fall apart. I was the youngest, the only one making good money, while my friends had to focus on jobs,
       college, and growing up. As my income dropped, so did my YouTube numbers. Without new tournaments and with the game plagued by
       cheaters and lag, everything I had worked for began to crumble.

        Lessons Learned

        <ul>
          <li>Never be too blind to change—my friends warned me about putting all my eggs in one basket.</li>
          <li>Always consider the bigger picture I saw the numbers decline, fewer subscribers, no new players, and I joined The Division too late.</li>
          <li>Everyone has their own path I tried to emulate Widdz and top players, but that burned me out and killed my passion.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

      <p>
        During this time, my drive to create videos and grind the game faded.
        I was burned out and confused. I started exploring new interests, like
        building Shopify websites and creating my own brand. But no game could hold my
        attention the way The Division did. I tried branching out, but when I posted
        other games, they didn’t get views, and I felt lost.
